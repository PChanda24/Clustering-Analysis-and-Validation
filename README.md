# Clustering Analysis & Validation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on clustering analysis using K-means and hierarchical clustering methods applied to both synthetic and real-world datasets. The primary goal is to identify patterns and groupings in the data, evaluate the clustering performance using external and internal validation metrics, and visualize the clustering results. The project demonstrates practical applications of clustering techniques in data science & analytics.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Clustering on Synthetic Datasets

**Datasets**: Data1.csv, Data2.csv, Data3.csv, Data4.csv, Data5.csv, Data6.csv, Data7.csv, Data8.csv

**Steps**:
1. Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to each dataset.
2. Evaluated clustering performance using external validation metrics.
3. Visualized clusters and compared them with original classes.

### Task 2: Clustering on World Indicators Dataset

**Dataset**: world_indicators.csv

**Steps**:
1. Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries.
2. Used internal validation metrics to assess cluster quality.
3. Reported the best clustering solution and key indicators, detailing the groups and countries within them and visualized the clustering results with scatter plots for different indicators.
