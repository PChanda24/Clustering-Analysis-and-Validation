# Clustering Analysis & Validation Project

## Key Highlights

### Comprehensive Clustering Analysis: 
Utilize K-means and hierarchical clustering to analyze synthetic datasets and world indicators, revealing meaningful groupings and trends.
### Performance Validation: 
Implement accuracy and F1 score metrics to evaluate the clustering results, ensuring robust and reliable analysis.
### Interactive Visualizations: 
Create informative scatter plots and dendrograms that highlight the clustering results, providing clear and insightful visual representations.
### Data-Driven Insights: 
Apply clustering techniques to real-world data, such as world indicators, to identify similar countries based on various socio-economic factors.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Clustering on Synthetic Datasets

**Datasets**: Data1.csv, Data2.csv, Data3.csv, Data4.csv, Data5.csv, Data6.csv, Data7.csv, Data8.csv

**Steps**:
1. Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to each dataset.
2. Evaluated clustering performance using external validation metrics.
3. Visualized clusters and compared them with original classes.

### Task 2: Clustering on World Indicators Dataset

**Dataset**: world_indicators.csv

**Steps**:
1. Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries.
2. Used internal validation metrics to assess cluster quality.
3. Reported the best clustering solution and key indicators, detailing the groups and countries within them and visualized the clustering results with scatter plots for different indicators.
